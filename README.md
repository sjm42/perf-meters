# perf-meters

A tiny program to control analog VU meters hooked up with USB.

It works on Linux and Windows 7/10/11 (tested, binary was built in Windows 10).

Other OSes are supported as per what sysinfo crate is able to support.

The firmware for the microcontroller can be found here: <https://github.com/sjm42/vumeter-usb>
